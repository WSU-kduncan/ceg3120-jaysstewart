# Setup
1. You get the API token from the discord developer portal under the 'Bot' tab
2. You put the token in the DISCORD_TOKEN environment variable in a hidden .env file
3. had to install python3 and discord.py using pip
# Usage
- Command 'scav!': prints a scav voiceline from the game Escape from Tarkov
- Command 'usec!': prints a usec voiceline from the Escape from Tarkov
- Command 'onion!': prints an image of spiderman enjoying a delicous onion ring
# Research
- The best solution would be to ssh into a server like AWS or a google server and run the python script in the background. Running the script on a server would allow for it to be always active, and running it in the background would allow the remote server to be used for other purposes.
